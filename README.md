## Description: 

The primary motivation for creating Tech-Blog was to establish a CMS-style blog site (e.g., wordpress) so that I can publish articles and blog posts. Additionally, I would also like to express my opinions and thoughts relating to posts created by others.
The problem being addressed and resolved with this app is providing a common blog site that my team can easily access and express issues and concerns.

By creating this app, I learned the following: 
*    designing a view interface that utilizes the Handlebars.js templating language;
*    using Sequelize as the ORM;
*    incorporating the express-session node package for user authentication and authorization; and,
*    incorporating the JawsDB add-on at the Heroku site where this app was deployed.
